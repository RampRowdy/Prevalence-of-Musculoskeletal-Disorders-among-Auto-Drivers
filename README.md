Prevalence of Musculoskeletal Disorders among Auto Drivers

This project explores the health and lifestyle patterns of auto-rickshaw drivers, with a focus on the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). The study was carried out using survey data and visualized entirely using Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn).

üîç What This Project Covers
Lifestyle Factors:
Analyzed habits such as smoking, drinking, and participation in recreational activities, highlighting how these impact overall health.

Chronic Conditions:
Visual breakdowns of participants with conditions like diabetes, hernia, thyroid issues, and blood pressure.

Quality of Life (SF-36 Domains):
Compared different health domains such as physical functioning, vitality, mental health, and social functioning using histograms with KDE plots.

Musculoskeletal Pain by Body Region:
Identified which areas (e.g., lower back, shoulder, knees) are most commonly affected. Lower back pain had the highest prevalence at over 50%.

Pain vs. Health Quality Associations:
Studied how pain in specific body parts correlates with physical and emotional well-being scores from the SF-36 health survey.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

üí° Key Insights
A significant number of participants reported musculoskeletal pain, especially in the lower back and neck.

Only a small portion of drivers engaged in recreational activities.

Health quality scores varied based on the presence of chronic illnesses and pain complaints.
